## What is this language about?
lo3 is a token based interpreted programming language written in C.

## Learn the syntax
See [learn-the-syntax](https://lo3-lang.github.io/learn-the-syntax/) for examples and documentation.

## Run lo3 at your own machine

This will start the interpreter and run your code.

## Compile it yourself

### Linux:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./bin/lo3 test.lo3
```

### Win:
```powershell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
.\bin\lo3.exe test.lo3
```

## Add it to the PATH

### Linux:

If you are root / have rights to sudo:
```
sudo cp ./bin/lo3 /usr/local/bin/
```

Or if you dont:
```
cp ./bin/lo3 ~/.local/bin/
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

> Then you can just write `lo3 ...`

### Windows:
Press `Win+R` input `sysdm.cpl`
In more (or any other name) > Environment Variables
